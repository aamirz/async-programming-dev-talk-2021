# async-programming-dev-talk-2021

This repository contains code examples for presentations on asyncrhonous programming. 

Each folder (`part-i`, where `i` is the corresponding presentation) contains a `Dockerfile` defining the environment necessary for executing each example. If you already have Docker installed, you can setup the environment by running: 

```
> cd part-i
> chmod +x setup_env.sh
> ./setup_env.sh
```
